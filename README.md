# Bürokratt's Chat Bot

# Scope

This repo will primarily contain:

1. Architectural and other documentation;
2. Docker Compose file to set up and run Bürokratt's Chat Bot as a fully functional service;

## Dev setup

* Clone [Ruuter](https://github.com/buerokratt/Ruuter)
* For Apple Silicon, replace Ruuter's Dockerfile line and add platform specification `FROM --platform=linux/amd64 openjdk:17-jdk-alpine`
* Ruuter has an unresolved issue with allowing cross-origin credentials to be sent, for now fix this by adding:
`.allowCredentials(true);` to line 24 in CORSConfiguration.java
* Navigate to Ruuter and build the image `docker build -t ruuter .`
* Clone [Resql](https://github.com/buerokratt/Resql)
* Navigate to Resql and build the image `docker build -t resql .`
* Clone [TIM](https://github.com/buerokratt/TIM)
* Navigate to Resql and build the image `docker build -t tim .`
* Install Python
* Navigate to setup and run `python3 generate-certs.py`
* Navigate to current repo and run `docker-compose up -d`
* Go to https://localhost:3001

### Database setup
 * For setting up the database initially, run 
 `docker run --platform linux/amd64 --network=bykstack riaee/byk-users-db:liquibase20220615 --url=jdbc:postgresql://users_db:5432/byk --username=byk --password=01234 --changelog-file=./master.yml update`
 * Run migrations added in this repository by running the helper script `./migrate.sh`
 * When creating new migrations, use the helper `./create-migration.sh name-of-migration` which will create a timestamped file in the correct directory and add the required headers


### TIM Cookies
 * To be able to use endpoints, you must have a valid cookie generated by TIM so that TIM can validate it
 * for example in test DB To create a valid TIM JWT, call cs-login and pass `{"login": "EE30303039914"}` and then copy the value of jwt response and added it as the value for the cookie named `customJwtCookie`
